All the tables automatically reload data from the node. When the cursor is put
into a table cell or sorting order is changed, the automatic reload is stopped.

The auto-reload can be resumed at any time, also the page can be reloaded
manually, using Ctrl+R shortcut or the corresponding tool bar button.
