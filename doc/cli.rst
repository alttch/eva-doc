eva-shell
=========

The primary command-line tool to manage EVA ICS nodes is **eva-shell**, which
is either :doc:`installed <install>` automatically or can be added later, by
including "eva-shell" Python module in the Python virtual environment.

    with eva-shell IoT management is a joy

EVA ICS v4 eva-shell can work in both command-line and interactive mode (type
"eva" without arguments to start it).

The interactive mode provides various features, like TAB-auto-completion,
command repetitions ("command \|T" or "command \|cT", where T is the command
interval, in seconds) etc.

Installing/updating
-------------------

eva-shell is not included into EVA ICS distribution any longer (but may be
installed automatically). To install/update it, either edit
"eva/config/python-venv" :doc:`registry</registry>` key, specify the desired
version in "extra" section (e.g. *eva-shell>=0.0.1*) and rebuild the Python
virtual environment (*/opt/eva4/sbin/venvmgr build*). Or execute:

.. code:: shell

    /opt/eva4/sbin/venvmgr add eva-shell
    # or 
    /opt/eva4/sbin/venvmgr add eva-shell==N # where N = version number

The latest eva-shell version number can be obtained from
https://pypi.org/project/eva-shell/

.. _eva-cloud-manager-cli:

EVA Cloud Manager CLI
=====================

EVA Cloud manager CLI is a powerful command-line tool, which allows to perform
certain tasks on the local node/cloud without eva-shell, such as updating
nodes, performing cloud deployment etc.

The tool is used by the node process and eva-shell, but can be called directly
as well.

Always installed by default, location: */opt/eva4/bin/eva-cloud-manager*

Bus CLI
=======

Various calls to the EVA ICS core and services can be performed via `ELBUS
<https://elbus.bma.ai/>`_ with "sbin/elbus" command-line tool.

.. note::

    EVA ICS bus RPC uses MessagePack-packed payloads. To convert YAML to
    MessagePack, a provided tool "bin/yml2mp" can be used.

Registry management
===================

Command-line tools
------------------

* **sbin/eva-registry-cli** registry command-line tool (included by default)

* **sbin/key-as-source** and **sbin/key-set-flag** wrappers around
  "eva-registry-cli" for certain tasks.
    
* **sbin/eva-edit-python-venv** edit Python virtual environment configuration.

Python VENV management
======================

A tool **sbin/venvmgr** can be used to quickly setup/manage the optional Python
virtual environment (requires for Python services and certain tools).
