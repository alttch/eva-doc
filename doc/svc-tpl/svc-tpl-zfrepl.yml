config:
  # the service can work in three roles:
  #
  # collector - collects data from the local node bus events to mailboxes,
  # always online. Must have the "collector"
  #
  # standalone - allows only to import manually copied blocks from a local dir
  #
  # replicator - serves and collects the data from the mailboxes via pub/sub,
  # MUST be deployed on the same machine as the collector. Must have the
  # "replicator" section
  collector:
    # mailboxes location, relative to EVA_DIR or absolute. if running under a
    # restricted user account (default: eva), the directory MUST be created
    # manually and the effective account must have read/write/execute (list)
    # permissions to it
